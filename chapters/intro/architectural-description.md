## Communication Requires State at the Endpoints

Internet communication involves more than simply transferring data between machines. In practice, two hosts rarely exchange a single message and stop. Instead, their interaction typically spans multiple transmissions. Later transmissions depend on earlier ones, and that dependence forces both hosts to keep track of what has already happened. They record what has been sent, what has been acknowledged, and what remains pending. Without this continuity, packets may still arrive, but they no longer form a coherent session.

This requirement for continuity shaped the design of the Internet architecture. The network layer was intentionally kept simple. It forwards data between addresses on a best-effort basis and does not guarantee reliability or ordering. It does not attempt to preserve the state of ongoing exchanges. Responsibility for reliability and ordering is therefore shifted to the communicating hosts. The end-to-end principle formalized this design philosophy, arguing that functions requiring application-level knowledge should reside at the endpoints rather than inside the network infrastructure [@saltzer1984end]. As a result, session management became the responsibility of transport protocols running on hosts.

Clark later characterized this placement of state as fate-sharing [@10.1145/52325.52336]. Under this model, state associated with a communication remains only at the host that depends on it and disappears if that host fails. Routers forward data without retaining information about ongoing exchanges. Links may fail and routes may change, yet the hosts continue to maintain their own communication state. Network disruption may interrupt delivery, but it does not erase the session state stored at the endpoints.

## Session Identity Derived from Network Location

This architectural decision has a direct consequence. Because the network does not maintain knowledge of active sessions, each host must determine how incoming data corresponds to its stored state. That determination requires some form of identification. In the classical Internet design, identification is derived from the source and destination addresses together with their port numbers. A transport connection is distinguished by this combination. In effect, session identity is bound to network location.

This binding of session identity to network location did not emerge accidentally. In the original Internet architecture, IP addresses served both as routing locators and as host identifiers. As later observed in the Host Identity Protocol literature, "in the current IP architecture, the IP addresses assume the dual role of acting both as host identifiers and locators" [@nikander2010host]. In the early days of the Internet, when hosts were typically stationary and address assignments were relatively stable, this dual use did not pose practical problems. The architecture itself deliberately avoided maintaining connection state within the network core [@10.1145/52325.52336], and no separate namespace for host identity was defined. Under those conditions, deriving transport connection identity directly from IP addresses and port numbers was a reasonable and efficient design choice.

## When Location Changes but Identity Persists

Over time, however, the deployment environment changed. Mobility became common, and network attachment points grew increasingly dynamic. As recognized in the development of Mobile IP, a node that changes its point of attachment "would then not be able to maintain transport and higher-layer connections when it changes location" without additional support [@rfc3775]. At the same time, widespread use of network address translation and dynamic address assignment weakened what the HIP literature describes as the "classical network-layer addressing invariants" [@nikander2010host]. In such environments, a host may remain active while its IP address changes. When transport-layer identity is defined by that address, the change appears as the termination of one endpoint and the emergence of another. The session is therefore disrupted, even though the communicating application has no intention to terminate.

This tension between stable session state and unstable network location did not go unnoticed. Over the years, there have been numerous attempts to decouple identity from addressing in different layers of the stack. Mobile IP, for example, attempted to maintain reachability by forwarding traffic from a home address to a temporary care-of address [@rfc3775]. The Host Identity Protocol proposed a new namespace between the network and transport layers, explicitly separating host identity from IP addresses altogether [@nikander2010host]. At the transport layer, protocols such as SCTP [@rfc4960] and later Multipath TCP [@10.1007/978-3-642-20757-0_35] sought to tolerate address changes or use multiple paths simultaneously. Each of these approaches recognized the same underlying issue: when identity is defined by location, mobility becomes a disruption rather than a normal operating condition.
