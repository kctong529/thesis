> "Without specific support for mobility in IPv6, packets destined to a mobile node would not be able to reach it while the mobile node is away from its home link... the mobile node would then not be able to maintain transport and higher-layer connections when it changes location."

- Location change breaks transport connections
- Transport depends on stable IP
- Identity was implicitly bound to location

> "The movement of a mobile node away from its home link is thus transparent to transport and higher-layer protocols."

- Mobile IP tries to hide location change from transport
- Mobile IP = solve identity/location split at network layer
- Mobility was recognized early, but solved below transport
