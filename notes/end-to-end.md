> The function in question can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the endpoints of the communication system. Therefore, providing that questioned function as a feature of the communication system itself is not possible.

- TCP assumed stable endpoints
- Reliability and state live end-to-end
- But identity was implicitly bound to IP
- QUIC preserves end-to-end semantics but changes how endpoints are identified
